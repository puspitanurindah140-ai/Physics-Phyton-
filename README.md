# **About the Project**

---

This repository contains a collection of numerical computation projects I completed during my undergraduate studies. 
The main objective of these projects is to implement various physics and mathematical concepts and formulas through Python programming in VS Code.

The topics covered include:

- Curve Fitting
- Numerical Integration and Differentiation
- Data Interpolation
- Linear System Solving using Matrices
- Root Finding Methods
- Differential Equations

Through these projects, I learned how theoretical concepts in physics and mathematics can be transformed into efficient and practical computational solutions.
